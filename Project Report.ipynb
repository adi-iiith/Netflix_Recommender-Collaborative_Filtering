    "## Introduction of topic/ Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "A recommendation system is a type of information filtering system which attempts to predict the preferences of a user, and make suggests based on these preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main approaches are widely used for recommender systems. One is content-based filtering, where we try to profile the users interests using information collected, and recommend items based on that profile. The other is collaborative filtering, where we try to group similar users together and use information about the group to make recommendations to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems are often based on Collaborative Filtering (CF), which relies only on past user behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary approaches to facilitate comparison of items v/s users, which constitute the two main disciplines of CF: the neighborhood approach and latent factor models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighborhood methods are centered on computing the relationships between items or, alternatively, between users. An item oriented approach evaluates the preference of a user to an item based on ratings of similar items by the same user. In a sense, these methods transform users to the item space by viewing them as baskets of rated items. This way, we no longer need to compare users to items, but rather directly relate items to items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Latent factor models, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD),comprise an alternative approach by transforming both items and users to the same latent factor space, thus making them directly comparable. The latent space tries to explain ratings by characterizing both products and users on factors automatically inferred from user feedback. For example, when the products are movies, factors might measure obvious dimensions such as comedy vs. drama, amount of action, or orientation to children; less well defined dimensions such as depth of character development or “quirkiness”; or completely uninterpretable dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighborhood models are most effective at detecting very localized relationships. They rely on a few significant neighborhood-relations, often ignoring the vast majority of ratings by a user. Consequently, these methods are unable to capture the totality of weak signals encompassed in all of a user’s ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Latent factor models are generally effective at estimating overall structure that relates simultaneously to most or all items. However, these models are poor at detecting strong associations among a small set of closely related items, precisely where neighborhood models do best.\n",
    "<br><b>\n",
    "In this projec, we build a combined model that improves prediction accuracy by capitalizing on the advantages of both neighborhood and latent factor approaches.</b>"

In addition, movies released within the same time period could also receive a boost in likelihood for recommendation.\n",
